# Process-Scheduling
Performs a deterministic analysis of the below scheduling algorithms by simulating them in C++

1. First Come First Serve(FCFS)
2. Shortest Job Next Preemptive(SJNP) or Shortest Remaining Time Next(SRTF)
3. Shortest Job Next Non-preemptive(SJNNP) or Shortest Job First(SJF)
4. Round Robin(RR)
5. Priority Scheduling Non-preemptive
6. Priority Scheduling Preemptive
